# GUI_PROJECT
THE GUI PROJECT IS ABOUT BUS RESERVATION SYSTEM IN JAVA USING GUI
Preferebly i always run the files in commandprompt. i will give step by step process to run GUI application through command prompt.
Firstly,Save u program or code file
STEP 1: Go to notepad and write u code and at topmost u see the text called "File" press on it and click on "Save as" u will get a window
"File Explorer" and u have to give ur Main class name as File name.
EX: My Main class name is LUI. so,i create my file name as "LUI.java" and the before saving u should check the file must be in all files not 
txt document which u find below creating class name.
now copy the Path where u saved the program file and go to Command Prompt(Cmd).
After opening Cmd type as "cd filepath(your filepath)"
after u will filepath will come now as i said my class name is LUI so i type "javac LUI.java" it finds any if there is any errors in code.
IF not it again shows path.NOW TYPE"java LUI".It executes the code and u will see a output of a frame.
